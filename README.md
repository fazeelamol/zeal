## VEHICLE DETECTION AND TRAFFIC MONITORING SYSTEM
This Python program detects vehicles in a video stream and monitors traffic volume using computer vision techniques. It utilizes OpenCV for video processing and vehicle detection.
### FEATURES:
- Real-Time vehicle detection and tracking
- Traffic volume monitoring 
- Warning for high traffic volume
### PREREQUISITES:
- Python 3.8.5
- OpenCV library (cv2)
- NumPy library (numpy)
### Installation:
1. Install Python 3.8.5 from [https://python.org] (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install required libraries:
    pip install opencv-python numpy
### Usage:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Place your video file named video.mp4 in the same directory as the program.
3. Run the program: python vehicle_detection.py
4. The program will display the original video stream with vehicle detection and traffic volume monitoring.

### Configuration:

- You can adjust parameters such as minimum width and height of detected rectangles, count line position, and offset for vehicle detection in the program code.

## Additional Notes:

- Make sure to adjust the parameters according to your specific requirements and video characteristics.
- This program assumes a constant camera angle and relatively stable lighting conditions for accurate detection.
